The updated advisory for persons who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 can be found at this link. Persons with mild ARI symptoms should stay at home until symptoms resolve. If you test positive with an ART test, you should regard yourself as being infected with COVID-19. Avoid close contact with others while still symptomatic. You may return to normal activities when your symptoms resolve.</p><h4>How do I protect myself against COVID-19?</h4><p>Vaccination remains our first line of defence against COVID-19. Our high vaccination rates have been pivotal to enable us to weather successive waves of COVID-19 infections, build up our societal resilience, protect our healthcare system, and arrive at the endemic COVID-19 norm today. The latest vaccination guidelines can be found at this link.</p><blockquote><p></p></blockquote>
